This microservice is designed for user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and is implemented in JavaScript using [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) principles. The aim is to provide a production-ready, open-source solution for secure user authentication.

By using JWT and Clean Architecture, we are ensuring that the microservice is both secure and maintainable. JWT is a widely-used standard for token-based authentication, while Clean Architecture provides a structured approach to designing and organizing code, making it easier to understand, modify, and extend.

By making the microservice open-source, we are providing a valuable resource to the developer community, and enabling others to use, contribute to, and improve the microservice for their own needs.
