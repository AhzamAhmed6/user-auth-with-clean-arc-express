# User Authentication Microservice with Clean Architecture

This microservice provides user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and is built in JavaScript following the principles of [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html). The objective is to offer a production-ready, open-source solution for secure user authentication.

### Why Clean Architecture and JWT?

By leveraging Clean Architecture, we ensure maintainable code that's easy to understand and extend. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are employed for token-based authentication, enhancing security and scalability.

### Technology Stack

The microservice is built using the following technologies:

- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: A widely-used NoSQL database for scalable and flexible data storage.


### Features

- Secure user authentication through JWT tokens.
- Built on the principles of Clean Architecture for maintainability.
- Open-source, allowing the developer community to contribute and improve.
